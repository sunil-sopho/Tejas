Tejas directory structure
------------------------------

doc			- contains explanation of the functionality and working of 
		  	  source code with suitable examples
LICENSE		- Contains the terms and conditions for use, reproduction and distribution
MAINTAINERS	- who is responsible for what description
NOTICE		- copyright notice
README		- Contains instructions to build and provides overview of Tejas
src		    - all real code for Tejas is in this directory (description below)
TODO		- if you have some time available and you want to have some fun, 
		      check this file and help improve Tejas


src directory structure
-----------------------

configure	      - configuration script
emulator	      - source files of the emulator (Implemented in C++)
simulator	      - source files of the simulator (Implemented in Java)

/src/simulator/ :
generic 	      - functionalities used across packages
	    	        for example : event queue is used by memory-system and pipeline
misc	  	      - miscellaneous functions
memory  	      - cache simulator
pipeline	      - pipeline simulation
config  	      - used to set various configuration parameters such as underlying architecture,
		    	    number of cores, and branch-predictor 
power   	      - power modelling of the system using performance counters
net	  	          - simulate the on-chip network to estimate the delay due to bus-contention
emulatorinterface - interface to the emulator


/src/simulator/emulatorinterface :
translator            - translates the assembly-format of the executable to abstract instruction
translator/x86        - x86 translator
translator/mips       - mips translator
translator/arm        - arm translator
communication         - used to take the value from the emulator
communication/shm     - shared memory
communication/pipe    - pipe
communication/network - network
communication/socket  - sockets
instruction 	      - abstract format of the instruction
